Dr. Peyton is a leading expert in the field of biomedical engineering. He has proven to be one of the most advanced and assured thinkers within medical imaging technology, and his endeavors have enabled significant developments both for Butterfly Network and the wider biomedical field.

I work closely with Dr. Peyton at Butterfly Network, designing the imaging algorithms for our wireless wearable device. He is deeply and crucially involved in the research, development, design, and implementation of integrated circuit analog signal chains and high-speed transmitter interface designs, which are critical to improving the images generated by our ultrasound technology. Graham has also made important contributions in combining the latest wireless technology with our ultrasound device, and in optimizing algorithms that translate ultrasound waves into 2D cross-sectional images for transmission over a wireless network. Building on his groundbreaking Ph.D. work, during which Dr. Peyton invented a revolutionary ultrasound microchip, he is a lead developer of a world-first medical wearable solution that monitors chronic diseases and bodily functions. 

This is of particular significance and importance because of the advantages enabled by portable, life-saving ultrasound treatment, which is both cheaper and more accessible than conventional methods. It means that the revolutionary work Dr. Peyton is doing with us at Butterfly Network has the chance to permanently alter the medical imaging industry. Companies and institutions are always attempting to reduce the cost, size, power consumption and data bandwidth required for ultrasound imaging, and his contributions and expertise are hypercritical to solving these needs. Graham is an instrumental figure in developing our latest product and has added insight and expertise in our acquisition of a preliminary patent for our work. The patent, on which he is a co-author with me, presents techniques for offloading data in an efficient way over a wireless network, and on various applications of a wearable, wireless ultrasound device/patch.

Dr. Peyton has proven himself to be invaluable to the growth and progress of this crucial medical area, and he is a rare asset who will continue to render essential and invaluable contributions to our company. I would be more than happy to provide any further information you may need.Dr. Peyton is a leading expert in the field of biomedical engineering.

I have not supervised Graham's research but know about him from his CV and also because I have had contact with him as a result of our both being alumni of the University of the Witwatersrand. 
 
His CV shows him to be highly talented. Contact with his supervisors records him to be making excellent progress in his PhD studies. Contact with him has furthermore, revealed him to be a highly personable individual. Altogether, he has a prospect of a highly successful career.
